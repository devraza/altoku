# Altoku
`altoku` is a TUI japanese media aggregate written in Rust.

## Features
Here's a featurelist for *a finished* `altoku`:
- Watch anime
- Fetch anime
- Fetch manga
- Fetch light novels
- Anilist integration

Altoku is actively being worked on, but as of writing has very little functionality for what it intends to be.

## Installation

To build `altoku`, you'll need [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed:
```bash
$ git clone https://git.devraza.giize.com/devraza/altoku
$ cd altoku
$ cargo build --release # `--release` adds a few optimisations
```

> **Using the flake!**
> This repository contains a `flake.nix` - if you have Nix installed, you can run `nix run github:devraza/altoku` to compile and run the program.
